move ~dot-emacs~ to your home directory, rename to ~.emacs~, and restart your emacs

- I use GNU Emacs
- make sure you can connect to melpa
- comment package you don't need in ~conf.org~ to speed up
- comment programming packages, some of them will fail emacs if you haven't installed on your OS

NOTE:

- directly use ~org~ format file to config emacs, not just for readme.
- there are ~heavy~ packages, before you restart emacs, you'd better comment the packages you don't need
