I use GNU Emacs, and I use *org* file to config emacs, not just documentation. move this ~emacs~ directory to ~$HOME/.emacs~, restart your emacs, packages will be downloaded, installed and configured automatically.

** pay attention

- font setting may fail your emacs, comment it or change to font you have installed
- pdf-tools will install some libraries, if you don't read pdf in Emacs, commen it
- there are ~heavy~ coding related packages, you'd better comment packages you don't need

** major mode for coding

- [X] Rust - lsp
- [X] Clojure - cider
- [X] Python - lsp
- [X] Elixir - lsp
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Golang
- [ ] \LaTeX
- [ ] Java
