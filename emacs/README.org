* Personal Emacs configuration

I use org file to config my emacs, which makes configuration clean. move ~dot-emacs~ to your home directory and rename to ~.emacs~ and restart your emacs

- I use GNU Emacs
- make sure you can connect to melpa
- I use ~Rust~ and ~Clojure~ so far, comment these package in ~conf.org~ if you do not need them

** major prod mode

- [X] Rust
- [X] Clojure
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Golang
- [ ] Haskell
