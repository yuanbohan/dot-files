* Personal Emacs configuration

I use org file to config my emacs, which makes configuration clean. move ~dot-emacs~ to your home directory and rename to ~.emacs~ and restart your emacs

- I use GNU Emacs
- make sure you can connect to melpa
- comment package you don't need in ~conf.org~ to speed up
